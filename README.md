# SensorReading

This is my first ever android app project. The target for this app is to make a tool for sensor debugging. The OIS debugging is also included. 

Target function / steps for sensors:
1. Able to read output from all sensors, including data and name. 
2. Able to get access to enable/disable node. 
3. Able to get access to common nodes, such as poll delay, ODR and others.
4. Able to get access to random registers.

Target function for OIS:
1. Change OIS on / servo on / servo off status
2. Change scene_mode
3. Change angle_limit
4. Access to registers

I think quite a lot functions need driver and hal code support.
